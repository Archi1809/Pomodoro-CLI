# Pomodoro-CLI
This is a configuration file for zsh shell, and it is sourced (read and executed) by the shell itself when you start a new Zsh session.

If you wish to use this file as shell script or any other executable program, then make sure to save this content to a file named (say,pomodoro.sh), and then make it executable by running: chmod +x pomodoro.sh
Run script using : ./pomodoro.sh

## Remember to have lolcat and spd-say installed on your system for the script to work as intended.
